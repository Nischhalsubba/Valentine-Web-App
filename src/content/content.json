Always.\n\nFrom the first day we added each other... to the first time we met alone...\nto the nights we fell asleep on call...\nto the days you showed me the most real version of you...\n\nI do not just love the big moments.\nI love the quiet ones.\nThe kitchen call. The bathroom call. The random parking-lot destiny.\nThe way we made distance feel useless.\n\nSo today, I made you something small.\nNot expensive. Not loud.\nJust beautiful and true.\n\nWhen you are ready...\nLet us walk through our story again, mutu.",
